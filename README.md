# Overview

I'm a web developer with a passion for learning and improving. I built this e-commerce web app to stay updated on the latest web technologies and best practices with REACT. My goal is to create more user-friendly web applications as I continue to grow in the field of software engineering.

I developed an E-commerce web app, as a demonstration of my proficiency in the JavaScript language implementing the REACT framework. This web app is able to receive data from fakestoreapi.com and displays the products to the users. 

To run the web app locally:
* git clone
* cd ecommerce-app
* npm install
* npm 
* Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running (starting the server and navigating through the web pages) and a walkthrough of the code.}
